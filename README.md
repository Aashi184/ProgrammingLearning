How to practice a language !

Here are some exercises to help you improving your skills in any programming language.
The purpose of this exercise sheet is to allow anybody learning a new language to practise. Exercises are ordered by difficulty.
The exercises are taken from practical session of EPITA's first year or internet tutorials.
Document will be updated with new exercises and corrections are available for some languages.
Since I am far from knowing every programming language, some exercise may not be as easy as they could be.
Feel free to send me corrections for languages that are not available yet,
new exercises ideas or any mistakes that I could have made !
Good luck :)

Create a new project for the language you want to learn and add this file with the right 
extension (.c for c, .cpp for C++, .cs for C#, etc.) regarding the language.
You will need to add the corresponding headers/library/etc.
