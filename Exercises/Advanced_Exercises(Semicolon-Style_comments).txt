; How to practice a language !

; Here are some exercises to help you improving your skills in any programming language.
; The purpose of this exercise sheet is to allow anybody learning a new language to practise. Exercises are ordered by difficulty.
; The exercises are taken from practical session of EPITA's first year.
; Document will be updated with new exercises and corrections are available for some languages.
; Since I am far from knowing every programming language, some exercise may not be as easy as they could be.
; Feel free to send me corrections for languages that are not available yet,
; new exercises ideas or any mistakes that I could have made !
; Nothing will be clearly explained, you will just have exercises and corrections.
; You need to look for answers on the internet (stackoverflow.com is good for example) and search by yourself.
; Tutorials are available all around the internet, but searching by yourself helps you learning about things
; you were not looking for !
; Good luck :)

; Create a new project for the language you want to learn and add this file with the 
; right extension (.c for c, .cpp for C++, .cs for C#, etc.) regarding the language.
; You will need to add the corresponding headers/library/etc.
