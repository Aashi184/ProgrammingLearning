#Disclaimer
These exercises and corrections are not here to teach how to code in a clean way.
They are just here to teach the fundamentals of programming in different languages, and thus different syntaxes.
Code factorisation, splitting into different files, or coding style for example are not resepcted due to the fact that they are not the goal here and would decrease readability (especially splitting into files).
They are to be used as cheat sheets with quick access, not example of perfect code (thanksfully).
Thank you
